        "description": "Tired of hand cramps while getting lost in your favourite book? Want a guilt-free sweet treat that actually helps you read more comfortably?\n\nAdd a sprinkle of joy to your reading time with our 3D Printed Cake Slice Book Page Holder - a Side Quest Co. original design! \n\nThis clever little reading accessory is designed to keep your book pages held open with just one hand. Simply slide your thumb through the hole, rest the \"cake\" base against the spine, and the \"slice\" side holds the pages flat. It's perfect for reading in bed, standing on a crowded train, or while juggling a coffee (or a real slice of cake!) in your other hand.\n\nWhy use a boring page holder when you can use a delicious-looking slice of cake? Lovingly 3D printed to look like a classic layered cake with frosting and a cherry on top, this holder isn't just functional – it's a cute conversation starter and a fun accessory for any bookworm with a sweet tooth! It's the perfect guilt-free treat for your hands.\n\nDimensions - Width: 4 inches x Length: 1 inch x Height: 1.7 inches\n- Thumb Hole: 1 inch\n\nMaterials & Process:\nEach cake slice holder is carefully 3D printed using eco-friendly PLA filament. PLA is a durable, plant-based plastic derived from renewable resources like corn starch. The intricate details are built layer by layer with precision.\n\nTo keep your cake slice looking sweet, simply wipe it clean with a damp cloth if needed. Avoid exposing it to extreme heat (like leaving it on a car dashboard on a hot day) as this can cause the plastic to warp.\n\nThis cake slice book page holder makes a delightful and unique gift for:\n\nBook lovers & avid readers\nStudents & Teachers\nBakers & Dessert enthusiasts\nAnyone who reads physical books!\nStocking stuffers, birthdays, holidays, or just because!\n\nAdd this sweet slice to your reading routine or gift it to your favorite bookworm!\n\nThank you for supporting our small business!",
